Subject: [digilib-devel] digilib gets new project home page!
Message-ID: <52263216.9020701@mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de>

Dear digilib fans,

after years upon years with the same old dusty HTML pages on

http://digilib.berlios.de

despite all ongoing development on the code in the Mercurial repository
<http://hg.berlios.de/repos/digilib> we now have a new project home page
thanks to the magic of Markdown[1] and the Maven site plugin[2] adn its
Fluido[3] skin (and me actually writing some documentation...)!

I have also updated the rest of the BerliOS project page, hiding old
file releases and old documentation. If you miss anything on the new
page please tell me.

More information on how to embed digilib in your own pages and server
code is on the way. If you have any documentation for digilib that is
not up on the web, please send me your Markdown files.

Enjoy
	Robert
